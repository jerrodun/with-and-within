General:
[ ] The padding top and bottom need to be targetted to the section.id, to account for when more than one section exists on the page:
  [x] testimonials.liquid
  [x] modular-richtext.liquid
  [x] image-with-content.liquid
  [x] faq.liquid
  [x] location.liquid
  [x] service-blocks.liquid


service-blocks.liquid:
[x] Add back in a color setting for .service-block__meta

testimonials.liquid:
[x] Update the arrow icons. I'm seeing remenants of the old icon/buttons and the new combined. Double check this work.
[x] The previous button/icon is facing the wrong way. It needs to be flipped. 

image-with-content.liquid: 
[x] The image isn't taking up full height. Additionally, I want the image to ignore the wrapper/container and always take up 50% of the browser width (touching the left/right side of the browser based on its position setting). The content should still respect the container.

location.liquid:
[x] Adding a heading size setting here as well
